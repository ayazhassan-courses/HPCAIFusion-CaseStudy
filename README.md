# HPCAIFusion-CaseStudy
This study investigates the fusion of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) using the 2D transient heat equation as a benchmark. A research-oriented comparative analysis will be carried out to study accuracy, runtime, scalability, and the potential advantages of HPC–AI integration.
